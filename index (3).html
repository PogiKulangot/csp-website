            <h1>Get To Know Me!!!</h1>
            <p> Hello, I'm Joel! I was born in Las Vegas but I'm from the Phillipines! I've been to Japan twice and that's my favorite place to travel to! I went to Our Lady of Las Vegas for middle school and elementary school! </p>
            <p>When I first came to West Tech, I was nervous. As I attended this school longer, I've started warming up to it!
