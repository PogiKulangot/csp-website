            <h1>More About Me!</h1>
                <p>Ever since I was a kid, I was always interested in coding and becoming a software engineer. I've always wanted to code a video game. </p>
                <p>My backup plan if I didn't become a software engineer was to become a mathematician. Although, that career of becoming a mathematician was soon crushed after realizing you have to be good at math</p>
